# WordleSolver
My Wordle Algorithm

This is my Wordle Solver. It generates a list of the best wordle guesses based on a points system, valuing vowel use, how common the letters in the words are, and how many different letters are in the word (words with unique letters are prioritized).

It then allows you to enter the information you get from your guess (ie grey, yellow, and green letters) and narrows down the list accordingly.

I get pretty consisent solves with this version but there's definitely room for improvement.
